/**
 * JavaExecutableStandalone replacement for JavaExecutable for REST API Java Clients
 *
 * Extends this abstract class if you want to create your own java task.<br>
 * A java task is a task representing a java process as a java class.<br>
 * This class provides an {@link #init(java.util.Map)} that will get your parameters back for this task.
 * By default, this method does nothing.
 *
 * This class differs from JavaExecutable through the interfaces it offers. It can be sub-classed without the need
 * to include ProActive dependencies.
